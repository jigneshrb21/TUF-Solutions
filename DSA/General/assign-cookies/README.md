## 📝 Problem Statement

Consider a scenario where a teacher wants to distribute cookies to students, with each student receiving at most one cookie.

Given two arrays, **student** and **cookie** , the i^th value in the Student array describes the minimum size of cookie that the ith student can be assigned. The j^th value in the Cookie array represents the size of the j^th cookie. If **Cookie[j] >= Student[i]** , the j^th cookie can be assigned to the i^th student.

**Maximize** the number of students assigned with cookies and output the maximum number.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** student = [1, 2, 3] , cookie = [1, 1]</p><p>

**Output:** 1</p><p>

**Explanation:** You have 3 students and 2 cookies.</p>The minimum size of cookies required for students are 1 , 2 ,3.

You have 2 cookies both of size 1, So you can assign the cookie only to student having minimum cookie size 1.

So your answer is 1.

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** student = [1, 2] , cookie = [1, 2, 3]</p><p>

**Output:** 2</p><p>

**Explanation:** You have 2 students and 3 cookies.</p>The minimum size of cookies required for students are 1 , 2.

You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to assign cookies to all students.

So your answer is 2.

### Constraints

- 1 <= student.length <= 3*10^4
- 0 <= cookie.length <= 3*10^4
- 1 <= student[i] , cookie[j] <= 2^31 - 1
